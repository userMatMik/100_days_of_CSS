## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this small project. I created this component as a short break from bigger projects that Im currently working on.
Also this project is a part of my challenge - 100 days of coding :)

This project was fun and I was supprised how fast I build that generator and ofcourse I learn some new things for example:

- how to disadble text from copying

Hope you enjoy this small project.
